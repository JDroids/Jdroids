            The JDroids began in 2010 as an FLL team. We began with 6 rookie members and 2 coaches.

            In our first season, we won the NJ State Championship Teamwork Award and were top 10

            finalists for FTC Global Innovation.



            During our season of 2011, we had 9 members, 3 of which were rookies. We set a goal to raise

            awareness of STEM education and the FIRST programs in Wayne. We won the NJ State

            Championship Programming Award!

            In the 2012 season, we had 10 members, including 2 rookies. In this season, we won the NJ

            State Championship Judges Award and were the runners up for the US Department of Energy

            National Science Bowl. Quite a memorable last season in FLL!

            In 2013, the JDroids became an FTC team with 7 members, of which 3 were rookies. We began

            to promote FTC in Wayne Hills High School as there was no team or club in the school. We

            hosted the Wayne Hills Wrap Up meet and generated a great deal of interest in the FIRST

            robotics programs. We were also the Vermont FTC Championship Finalist Captain!

            In 2014, we had 8 members, including 3 rookies. We continued to promote STEM and the FTC

            program by hosting another Wrap Up meet at Wayne Hills High School and engaging the

            robotics teacher as a mentor. The mayor attended and was very impressed. We also worked

            with Pines Lake Elementary School with their forming of a robotics club. The JDroids were the

            Parkway Division Finalist Captains at the NJ State Championship Tournament!

            In the 2015 season, we had 10 members, including 6 rookies! Our longtime dream was realized

            when the work we performed in the community and the school inspired the creation of an FTC

            team in Wayne Hills High School! Also, in recognition of our work, the Mayor of Wayne issued

            a citation to our team commending us for promoting STEM education in our community.

            Quite an honor! </p>
